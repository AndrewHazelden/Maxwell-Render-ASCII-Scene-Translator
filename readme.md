# Maxwell Render ASCII Scene Translator #
**Version 1.0** Released 2015-12-03
by Andrew Hazelden

## Overview ##

The `mxs2ascii` tool will translate a binary format Maxwell Render .mxs scene file into an plain text ASCII format document. There is also a corresponding set of syntax highlighters that make it easier to review and edit this plain text version of a Maxwell Render scene.

Here is an example Maxwell ascii scene file with syntax highlighting enabled:

I hope this tool improves your coding workflow as you develop new Maxwell Scene files using a plain text editor.

Cheers,  
Andrew Hazelden
